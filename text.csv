Filters,'Filters allow to pass or block a requests based on some criteria. They decide which request to block by inspecting the "request" object.

Handling XML with Java?,'When you were dealing with CSV you had to write custom code to read and write CSV files. This is what we call serialization (writing objects to a file in a certain format) and deserialization (reading a file in a certain format into objects). You have to do something similar when dealing with XML, but it is a little more complex, and you have to get a grasp of the DOM concept.',false
Yet another language to master: Java,'Java programming language was originally developed by Sun Microsystems which was initiated by James Gosling and released in 1995 as core component of Sun Microsystems'' Java platform (Java 1.0 [J2SE]). The latest stable release of the Java Standard Edition is Java SE 9. With the advancement of Java and its widespread popularity, multiple configurations were built to suit various types of platforms. For example: J2EE for Enterprise Applications, J2ME for Mobile Applications. <br> <br> The new J2 versions were renamed as Java SE, Java EE, and Java ME respectively. Java is guaranteed to be Write Once, Run Anywhere. <br><ul><li>Object Oriented − In Java, everything is an Object. Java can be easily extended since it is based on the Object model.</li><li>Simple − Java is designed to be easy to learn. If you understand the basic concept of OOP Java, it would be easy to master.</li><li>Secure − With Java''s secure feature it enables to develop virus-free, tamper-free systems. Authentication techniques are based on public-key encryption.</li></ul>',true
